Build instructions from Neil Sharma:
1. 2x GRPC server (to talk to upload notes, to talk to retrieve notes)
(Server is just responding to requests)
2. We can choose between Unitary or bidirectional streaming
3. For client we should create simple client to upload notes
4. DB/Schema is up to us to create
5. Implement good logging, as a .log file
